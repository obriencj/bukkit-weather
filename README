This is a Bukkit plugin is intended to provide minimalistic weather
control options on a per-world basis. It integrates with the built-in
Bukkit permissions framework to allow users to override the weather
and time for a world temporarily, and to use a Mjolnir-like item
similar to the defunct MotherNature plugin.
